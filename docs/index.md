The original [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org)
[theme]((https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io)) was created for the
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) documentation generator, and so it is
designed specifically for docs.

Combined with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) it's a great and easy
way to document your projects!
